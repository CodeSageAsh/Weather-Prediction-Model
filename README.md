# Weather Prediction Using Decision Trees and Random Forest

## Overview

This project aims to predict weather conditions using machine learning models, specifically Decision Trees and Random Forest. The notebook demonstrates how to preprocess weather data, build predictive models, and evaluate their performance to understand patterns in weather forecasting.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes various weather-related features such as:
- **Temperature**: Current temperature readings
- **Humidity**: The amount of moisture in the air
- **Wind Speed**: The speed of wind at a given time
- **Pressure**: Atmospheric pressure
- **Weather Condition**: The target variable indicating different weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy)

## Project Structure

- **Data Exploration and Visualization**: Initial analysis of the data to identify patterns and correlations between weather variables.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Steps include cleaning the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and feature scaling.
- **Model Building**: Implementation of Decision Tree and Random Forest models for predicting weather conditions.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessment using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix to compare the performance of the models.
- **Feature Importance**: Analysis of which weather features are most influential in making accurate predictions.

## Key Findings

- Random Forest generally outperforms Decision Trees by reducing overfitting and improving prediction accuracy.
- Features like temperature and humidity are found to be significant in determining weather conditions.

## How to Use

1. **Open the notebook**:
   - Use Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment to run the code and see the model results.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
